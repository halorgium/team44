  Team 44 Music Library Installation

  Quick Start - Unix
  ------------------

  Installation of the system requires a ANSI C compiler. 

  $ ./configure PREFIX
      [ Replace PREFIX with the directory 
        within ${HOME}/public_html that 
        the application should be installed; 
        Please note if prefix argument is 
        omitted, the install will default 
        to the 'musiclib' directory ]
  $ make
  $ make install

  After the preceding command have been executed successfully, 
  the Music Library should be accessible through a web browser. 
  The URL will be similar to http://{HOST}/~{USER}/{PREFIX}/
    For example: 
    If the web application was installed by a user 'foobar' by 
    executing the following commands: 

     $ ./configure mylibrary
     $ make
     $ make install

     The web application would be installed into: 
       ${HOME}/public_html/mylibrary
     where ${HOME} is the users home directory. 

     If the web server providing the user's web pages was named 
     'wibble', then the web application would be accessible using 
     the URL: 
       http://wibble/~foobar/mylibrary/

  Quick Start - Windows
  ---------------------

  Please note the following: 
    o This application should not under any circumstances be 
      run, let alone installed on a Windows-based operating 
      system. 

    o Use of a Windows-based operating system can cause blindness 
      in your left eye. This is due to the excessive slowness of the 
      operating system. The Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) is another 
      common cause of eye injury and has caused emotional and 
      psychological damage in users across the globe. 

   Any attempt to install this application on a Windows-based 
   operating system is NOT supported NOR authorised by the developers. 

   If any indication of violation of the above statement is received 
   by the developers (either first-hand or nth-hand), you _may_ be 
   subjected to extended exposure to the Mirco$oft Paper-Clip.
