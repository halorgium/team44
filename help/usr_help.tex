\section{Introduction}
The Musiclib program is designed to support a library of music that can be accessed by registered users via the web. MusicLib allows users to find different albums within the database and take them out on loan for a period of time. Users can also read and write comments about the different artists and albums that are of interest.

\section{How To Use}
MusicLib is run through your web browser, and all you need to do is click on the desired links to access the functionality of the program. You must decide on a user name for yourself when you first log in. This allows the system to identify every different user in the system. If there are any problems with using the system emails can be sent to us (the programmers) via the ``Contact Us'' link.
