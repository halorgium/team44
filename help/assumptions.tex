\section{Big Assumptions}
On the user information page, Users may not wish to view all the comments made about an artist, album or user when seeing all the other details (especially if there are 600 or so comments). Instead there is a link to the comments page where all comments can be viewed. 

Librarians may make comments about themselves. We considered removing this but decided as team we felt that although this enable self-commenting. It is not of great concern as the author of the comment is recorded and therefore the librarians who have commented about themselves can easily be identified. 

Another question we answered as a team was: "Should a librarian be allowed to return albums that they themselves did not borrow?". In the end, we decided that this is not an appropriate librarian feature due to the nature of librarians. This may have been a useful feature for cleaning up if a user borrows an album and then is absent for an extended period of time.
